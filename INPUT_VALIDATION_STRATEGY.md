# Input Component Validation Strategy

## Context
We're building our design system's Input component and need to decide how to handle validation. This affects reusability, maintainability, and developer experience across our applications.

## Current State
Our Input component is clean and presentational-only:
- Size variants (sm, default, lg, touch)
- Proper styling with focus states
- No validation logic

## Three Approaches to Consider

### 1. Keep Input "Dumb" (Pure Presentation)
```typescript
// Validation handled externally
<Input type="email" />
// + React Hook Form, custom validation, etc.
```
**Pros:**
- Maximum reusability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Flexible for any validation library
- Easier testing

**Cons:**
- More setup required for each form
- Inconsistent validation UX across apps

### 2. Built-in Validation Props
```typescript
// Validation built into component
<Input type="email" validateEmail required minLength={5} />
```
**Pros:**
- Quick and convenient
- Consistent validation UX
- Self-contained

**Cons:**
- Component becomes bloated
- Limited flexibility
- Mixes UI and business logic
- Hard to customize validation rules

### 3. Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
```typescript
// Component reflects validation state, logic handled externally
<Input 
  type="email" 
  error="Please enter a valid email"
  state="error"
/>
```
**Pros:**
- Consistent visual validation states
- Flexible validation logic
- Reusable component
- Works with any validation library

**Cons:**
- Slightly more verbose than option 2

## Team Discussion Questions

Please consider these questions for our next team meeting:

1. **Validation Strategy**: What validation approach do we want to standardize on?
   - React Hook Form + Zod?
   - Custom validation hooks?
   - Form libraries like Formik?

2. **Design Consistency**: Should validation states have standardized visual treatments?
   - Error states (red border, error message)
   - Success states (green border, checkmark)
   - Warning states (yellow border)

3. **Project Complexity**: What types of forms are we building?
   - Simple contact forms
   - Complex multi-step wizards
   - Real-time validation
   - Server-side validation integration

4. **Developer Experience**: What's more important?
   - Quick setup (built-in validation)
   - Flexibility (external validation)
   - Consistency (hybrid approach)

5. **Team Preferences**: 
   - Do we prefer minimal components or convenience features?
   - How important is component reusability vs. ease of use?

## Next Steps
- Team discussion and vote on preferred approach
- Define validation state props (if hybrid approach)
- Update component implementation
- Create usage documentation and examples
